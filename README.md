HandyNotes - Hallow's End
=========================


What it does
------------

This addon displays locations of unvisited candy buckets on the worldmap and minimap while Hallow's End is active (18th - 31st October).
If you also have TomTom or Cartographer installed, you can right-click on a marker to create a Waypoint arrow.

Requires [HandyNotes](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes) to work.


Configuration
-------------

There are a few options you can modify, including:

* Icon size.
* Icon transparency.
* Show all icons, even if you have already visited that bucket.


Translations
------------

This addon should work for everyone regardless of language, but most of the text is currently only in English.
