HandyNotes - Hallow's End
=========================


What it does
------------

This addon will display locations of Hallow's End candy buckets on the worldmap and minimap.  
This addon requires [HandyNotes](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes) to work.


Configuration
-------------

By default, the markers for buckets you have already visited are hidden.  
You can toggle this, as well as icon size and transparency, in the HandyNotes config window.


Translations
------------

This addon should work for everyone regardless of language, but its text is currently only in English.
